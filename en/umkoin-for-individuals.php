    <h1>Umkoin for Individuals</h1>
    <p class="summary">Umkoin is the simplest way to exchange money at very low cost.</p>

    <h2 id="mobile"><img class="titleicon" src="/img/icons/ico_mobile.svg" alt="Icon"/>Mobile payments made easy</h2>
    <p>Umkoin on mobiles allows you to pay with a simple two step scan-and-pay. No need to sign up, swipe your card, type a PIN, or sign anything. All you need to receive Umkoin payments is to display the QR code in your Umkoin wallet app and let your friend scan your mobile, or touch the two phones together (using NFC radio technology).</p>

    <h2 id="secure"><img class="titleicon" src="/img/icons/ico_lock.svg" alt="Icon" />Security and control over your money</h2>
    <p>Umkoin transactions are secured by military grade cryptography. Nobody can charge you money or make a payment on your behalf. So long as you take the required steps to <a href="/en/secure-your-wallet.php">protect your wallet</a>, Umkoin can give you control over your money and a strong level of protection against many types of fraud.</p>

    <h2 id="simple"><img class="titleicon" src="/img/icons/ico_simple.svg" alt="Icon" />Works everywhere, anytime</h2>
    <p>Just like with email, you don't need to ask your family to use the same software or the same service providers. Just let them stick to their own favorites. No problem there; they are all compatible as they use the same open technology. The Umkoin network never sleeps, even on holidays!</p>

    <h2 id="international"><img class="titleicon" src="/img/icons/ico_international.svg" alt="Icon" />Fast international payments</h2>
    <p>Sending umkoins across borders is as easy as sending them across the street. There are no banks to make you wait three business days, no extra fees for making an international transfer, and no special limitations on the minimum or maximum amount you can send.</p>

    <h2 id="lowfee"><img class="titleicon" src="/img/icons/ico_lowfee.svg" alt="Icon" />Choose your own fees</h2>
    <p>There is no fee to receive umkoins, and many wallets let you control how large a fee to pay when spending. Most wallets have reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster <a href="/en/you-need-to-know.php#instant">confirmation</a> of your transactions. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it's possible to send 100,000 umkoins for the same fee it costs to send 1 umkoin.</p>

    <h2 id="anonymous"><img class="titleicon" src="/img/icons/ico_anon.svg" alt="Icon" />Protect your identity</h2>
    <p>With Umkoin, there is no credit card number that some malicious actor can collect in order to impersonate you. In fact, it is even possible to send a payment without revealing your identity, almost like with physical money. You should however take note that some effort can be required to <a href="/en/protect-your-privacy.php">protect your privacy</a>.</p>
